# Memory-Management-OS
This repository contains Java code that demonstrates memory management and page replacement algorithms. The PageReplacement class simulates various page replacement strategies, including FIFO, Optimal, and LRU, showcasing their page fault behavior. The Main class implements memory allocation algorithms like First Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit, displaying process allocations within available memory blocks. This code provides insights into memory optimization techniques and serves as a learning resource for students and developers interested in memory management concepts.



## PageReplacement Class:

This class focuses on simulating different page replacement algorithms for managing memory in a computer system.

1. The firstFit method:
* This method implements the First Fit memory allocation algorithm.
* It takes arrays representing block sizes (bSize) and process sizes (pSize), as well as the lengths of these arrays.
* It iterates through the processes and assigns them to the first block that can accommodate their size.

---

2. The worstFit method:

* This method implements the Worst Fit memory allocation algorithm.
* It takes arrays representing block sizes (bSize) and process sizes (pSize), as well as the lengths of these arrays.
* It iterates through the processes and assigns them to the block with the largest available size that can accommodate their size.

---

3. The bestFit method:

* This method implements the Best Fit memory allocation algorithm.
* It takes arrays representing block sizes (bSize) and process sizes (pSize), as well as the lengths of these arrays.
* It iterates through the processes and assigns them to the block with the smallest available size that can accommodate their size.

---

4. The main method:

* This method is where the simulation for memory allocation algorithms starts.
* It defines block sizes (bSize) and process sizes (pSize) arrays.
* It calls the firstFit, worstFit, and bestFit methods to simulate memory allocation for each algorithm.
* The results of the allocation (process numbers, sizes, and block numbers) are displayed for each algorithm.

In summary, the PageReplacement class simulates different page replacement algorithms for memory management, while the Main class implements and demonstrates memory allocation algorithms like First Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit.
